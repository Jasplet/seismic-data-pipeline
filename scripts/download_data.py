# Python script to remotely query data from NYMAR array stations
# We are using Wget as implemented in the requests library
# This script is designed to download all available dataÂ 
# From an installed Certimus/Minimus for a given period of time.

# If the instruments are networked then you can downalod data from mutliple
# Instruments by specifiying a dictionary of IP addresses.
# The example here uses a dictionary of IPs for intruments deployed
# for the North York Moors Array (NYMAR) and is read in from a json file.

# Data is requested in hourly chunks and then recombined into
#  a day length miniSEED file

# Some editing of this script could make it request minute chunks
# (for a whole day) or make hourly / minutely requests for data
