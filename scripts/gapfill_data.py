# Python script to remotely query data from NYMAR array stations
# We are using Wget as implemented in the requests library
# This script is designed to download data for specific channel
# or network codes. For a bulk download from all insturments
# in a network or array, use download_data.py
# In this script each tuple (net,sta,loc,chan, start, end) must be provided.
# This script is intended to be used for trying to fillin gaps in your dataset.

# If the instruments are networked then you can downalod data from mutliple
# Instruments by specifiying a dictionary of IP addresses.
# The example here uses a dictionary of IPs
# for intruments deployed for the North York Moors Array (NYMAR)
# and is read in from a json file.

# Data is requested in hourly chunks and then recombined
# into a day length miniSEED file

# Some editing of this script could make it request minute chunks
# (for a whole day) or make hourly / minutely requests for data
